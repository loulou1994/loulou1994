- 👋 Hi, I’m @loulou1994
- 👀 I’m interested in all things related to web development technologies
- 🌱 I’m planning to start teaching myself some backend notions. Nodejs seems to be the right choice these days 👍
- 💞️ I'm happy to say that I got a firm grap on the front-end side
- :punch: I'm all in for an HTML,CSS, JS, and React business project
